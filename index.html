        <p id="intro">Chicken Biryani is a delicious savory rice dish that is loaded with spicy marinated chicken, caramelized onions, and flavorful saffron rice.</p>
        <p>
          Chicken Biryani is a savory chicken and rice dish that includes layers of chicken, rice, and aromatics that are steamed together. The bottom layer of rice absorbs all the chicken juices as it cooks, giving it a tender texture and rich
          flavor, while the top layer of rice turns out white and fluffy. Buried in the Biryani, you'll find whole cuts of succulent chicken bursting with flavor from the potent array of spices, herbs, and aromatics it's marinated in.
        </p>
        <p>
          For my Chicken Biryani recipe, I've simplified the preparation a bit by marinating the chicken in a spicy mixture of garam masala, garlic, ginger, chili peppers, coriander leaves, and garlic. When fried, the spices and aromatics on the
          exterior of the chicken caramelize into an insanely flavorful crust. I like to make the fried onions separately, as it allows you to fully caramelize them into a sweet umami-packed layer that contrasts the spicy, savory chicken. For the
          rice, a quick par-boil with whole spices like cardamom, bay leaves, and cumin infuses some flavor, while ensuring the rice is tender enough steam after the Biryani is assembled.

        <h3 id="ingredients-for-chicken-biryani">Ingredients for Chicken Biryani</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Chicken</strong>&nbsp;- For the most flavor, I recommend using a bone-in skin-on piece of chicken such as thighs or drumsticks. Breast meat will work in a pinch, but it won't be as flavorful, and it will get dry due to the longer
            cooking time of this dish.&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li><strong>Aromatics</strong>&nbsp;- The chicken is marinated with ginger garlic paste along with herbs and spices. As the chicken steams, it releases all these flavors into the rice.&nbsp;</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Herbs</strong>&nbsp;- I like to use fresh herbs like cilantro (coriander leaves), and fresh mint leaves in my marinade for the chicken. These also make for a nice garnish to sprinkle on top of the Chicken Biryani, so be sure to
            chop up a little extra.&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Spices</strong>&nbsp;- I use ground spices like garam masala and ground cinnamon for the chicken marinade. If you can find it, Biryani masala works well too. For the rice, I include whole spices such as green cardamom, cumin, and
            bay leaves. I also sometimes like to add some cloves or star anise here. The yellow color in the rice comes from saffron, but if you can't find it, turmeric makes a suitable substitute.&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li><strong>Onions</strong>&nbsp;- Along with the chicken and rice, the third component of Biryani is fried onions, and I like to have a lot of them.&nbsp;</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ghee</strong>&nbsp;- Ghee is butter with the milk proteins and water removed, making it clear. This is why it's also called "clarified butter." It gives you the flavor of butter without worrying about the milk solids
            burning.&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li><strong>Chili Peppers</strong>&nbsp;- I usually use fresh green chilies in my marinade for the chicken to add some heat to this dish, but red chili powder will work as well.&nbsp;</li>
          <li><strong>Rice</strong>&nbsp;- Biryani should always be made with long-grain rice. I recommend using basmati.&nbsp;</li>

          <h4>Directions</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>
              To marinate the chicken for the biryani, combine the vegetable oil, garlic, ginger, chili peppers, mint, cilantro, garam masala, cinnamon and salt in a large bowl and stir together. Add the chicken pieces and toss together making sure
              the chicken is thoroughly coated in the marinade. Allow the chicken to marinate for at least 1 hour or up to overnight.
            </li>
            <li>In a pot wide enough to hold the chicken in a single layer, add the ghee and onions and saute the onions until they are well caramelized (15-20 minutes). Transfer the caramelized onions to a bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>While the onions caramelize, prepare the rice by washing in a strainer under cold running water until the water runs clear.</li>
            <li>To par-boil the rice, add the water, salt, cardamom, cumin and bay leaf to a pot and bring to a boil. Add the rice and boil for 7 minutes. Drain the rice, reserving 1 cup of the liquid.</li>
            <li>
              In the pot you caramelized the onions in, add the chicken in a single layer, skin-side down. Fry until golden brown on one side (about 5 minutes). Flip the chicken over and fry the other side until golden brown. Transfer the chicken
              back to the bowl you marinated it in.
            </li>
            <li>To assemble the biryani, add the saffron to the rice and toss to distribute evenly. Add half the rice mixture to the bottom of the pot you browned the chicken in.</li>
            <li>Top the rice with the chicken in a single layer.Top the chicken with an even layer of caramelized onions.</li>
            <li>
              Finish putting together the Biryani by adding the rest of the rice in an even layer. Add 1 cup of reserved liquid from boiling the rice. Cover the pot with a lid and put the pot on the stove over medium heat and set the timer for 20
              minutes. When you can see steam escaping from under the lid, turn down the heat to low and continue cooking until the timer goes off and then turn off the heat.
            </li>
            <li>Without opening the lid, set the timer for another 10 minutes to steam the biryani. Mix the Chicken Biryani together and then transfer to a serving platter. Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve.</li>
